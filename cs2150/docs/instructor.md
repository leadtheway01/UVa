PDR: Docs: Instructor Notes
===========================

[Go up to the main documents page](index.html) ([md](index.md))

This page is meant to be a set of notes to the instructor(s) of the course.  It is certainly not secret, but not likely to be all that interesting to the students.  But students are certainly welcome to read it!

Lecture progress
----------------

- [Lab 1](../labs/lab01/index.html) ([md](../labs/lab01/index.md)) (introduction): the in-lab requires getting through The 'Rational Example' section of the [C++ slide set](../slides/01-cpp.html), and ideally the 'Pre-Processor' section as well.
- [Lab 3](../labs/lab03/index.html) ([md](../labs/lab03/index.md))  (stacks) requires getting through the stacks slides in the [lists slide set](../slides/02-lists.html)
- [Lab 4](../labs/lab04/index.html) ([md](../labs/lab04/index.md)) (numbers): requires the use of command-line parameters for the post-lab, and those are discussed in the [Arrays & Big-Oh slide set](../slides/04-arrays-bigoh.html)
- [Lab 5](../labs/lab05/index.html) ([md](../labs/lab05/index.md)) (trees): requires getting through the sections in the [Trees slide set](../slides/05-trees.html) on expression trees and AVL trees (this information is needed for all three parts of the lab)
- The [06: trees](../slides/05-trees.html) slide set will likey require that the two animation sites be allowed to run in your browser, as they are both Java applets.  Those sites are [here](http://www.qmatica.com/DataStructures/Trees/BST.html) and [here](http://webdiis.unizar.es/asignaturas/EDA/AVLTree/avltree.html) (only one is needed, as the second is a mirror of the first).

Piazza Setup
------------

This is not really related to the materials in this repository, but here is how I set up Piazza.  This is included mostsly as a reference for me for future semesters.

- Log in (my account is under under my UVa ID)
- Under manage class
    - general settings:
        - there are other TAs for this course
		- instructor self-signup is disabled
	- Q&A settings
		- disable posting anonymously
		- possibly disable private posts
	- customize Q&A
		- create 11 labs, 2 midterms, and: final_exam, lecture, other, git, linux
	- enroll professors/TAs
		- mark me as lead instructor
		- enroll my TAs
		- enroll the students in the course (but *AFTER* the first lecture)
	- create groups
		- do nothing
	- customize course page
