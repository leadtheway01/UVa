For some of the lab deliverables, you will need to submit a PDF file.  You can edit this in any editor of your choice, as long as the file that you submit is a PDF.  There are a number of free ways to convert your file.


- Use [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), or a similar online document editor, that can export to PDF
- Use [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/), which is free software, and is similar to Microsoft Office.  To export to a PDF choose File -> Export As PDF.  Both install on Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X.
- You can install a free utility called [PDFCreator](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/), which will install a printer entry on your machine that will all you to print to a PDF file.
- You can use free online PDF conversion tools, such as [Free PDF Convert](http://www.freepdfconvert.com/) to convert it for you
- Under Linux, you can print directly to a file - just be sure to choose PDF as the file format, not PS
