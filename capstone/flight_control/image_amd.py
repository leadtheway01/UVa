    Send MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW message to point vehicle at a specified heading (in degrees).

    This method sets an absolute heading by default, but you can set the `relative` parameter
    to `True` to set yaw relative to the current yaw heading.

    By default the yaw of the vehicle will follow the direction of travel. After setting 
    the yaw using this function there is no way to return to the default yaw "follow direction 
    of travel" behaviour (https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/issues/2427)
