The CPP code is having issues locating the library

Comparitively, I ran simple Python code from the examples and it seemed to work. While I couldn't see the pin toggling (no LED or anything hooked up), I could tell that no errors were thrown and that it was looping due to print statements. 

This makes me think that I will be using Python for the PWM code.
