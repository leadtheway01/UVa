The first difficult problem I encountered was that I misinderstood the
concept of stack. I thought that the last in's next points the NULL,
which was incorrect. After an advice of TA, I was able to write the code
correctly.

The second difficult problem I had was that I named my own stack class
"stack" and had lots of errors when I compiled it. After changing the class
name to "myStack", most of the errors were gone.
