1) %cd ~/unixstuff should take me to the directory unixstuff but it was not.
Instead it was 'No such file or directory'. why?

2) %cp /vol/examples/tutorial/science.txt . 
above command didn't work for me. If I understood correctly it should copy
science.txt file to current directory, but it didn't. why?

3) Is pip only used when to redirect inputs and output?
